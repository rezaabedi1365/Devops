### Playbook Conditional
```
ansible all â€“m setup
```
```
ansible_os_family == "Debian"
ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
ansible_distribution == "CentOS"

ansible_pkg_mgr == "apt"

ansible_distribution_version == "22.04"
ansible_distribution_version|float >= 18

ansible_distribution_major_version == "22"
ansible_distribution_major_version|int >= 18
 

ansible_distribution_release == "jammy"
```
condition with sub fact
```
ansible_lsb.codename == "jammy"
ansible_python.version.major == 3
```


Example:
```
- name: playbook-Playbook Conditional
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Remove Apache on ubuntu Servers
      apt: name=apache2 state=absent
      when:
        - ansible_os_family == "Debian"

     - name: Remove Apache on Centos Servers
       apt: name=httpd state=absent
       when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" and ansible_lsb.major_release|int >= 6
```
```
tasks:
  - command: /bin/false
    register: result
    ignore_errors: True

  - command: /bin/something
    when: result is failed

  # In older versions of ansible use ``success``, now both are valid but succeeded uses the correct tense.
  - command: /bin/something_else
    when: result is succeeded

  - command: /bin/still/something_else
    when: result is skipped
```
