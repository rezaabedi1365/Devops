The error message:

> Error response from daemon: failed to set up container networking: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint ...: failed to start userland proxy for port mapping ...: fork/exec /home/namad/bin/docker-proxy: no such file or directory

means that Docker is unable to find the `docker-proxy` binary at `/home/namad/bin/docker-proxy`. This binary is required for Docker to set up port forwarding between your host and the container.

## Why This Happens

- The `docker-proxy` executable is missing from the specified path.
- The Docker installation is incomplete or corrupted.
- Docker is configured to look for `docker-proxy` in a custom or incorrect location.

## How to Fix

**1. Verify if `docker-proxy` exists**

Check if the binary exists at the path Docker is looking for:

```bash
ls -l /home/namad/bin/docker-proxy
```

If it does not exist, that's the cause of the error.

**2. Locate the correct `docker-proxy` binary**

On most systems, `docker-proxy` is installed in `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`. Try to locate it:

```bash
find / -name docker-proxy 2>/dev/null
```

**3. Fix the missing binary**

- If you find `docker-proxy` elsewhere (e.g., `/usr/bin/docker-proxy`), create a symlink:

  ```bash
  ln -s /usr/bin/docker-proxy /home/namad/bin/docker-proxy
  ```

- If `docker-proxy` is missing entirely, reinstall Docker to restore all required binaries:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install --reinstall docker-ce
  # or use your system's package manager
  ```

  Reinstalling Docker is a common solution for this issue[2][4][6].

**4. Check Docker configuration**

If you have customized Docker's configuration to use a non-standard binary path, ensure it points to the correct location.

**5. Restart Docker**

After fixing the binary, restart Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
